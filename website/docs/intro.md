# Rewind

**Rewind** is a fast, lightweight explorer for the **Arweave Name System (ArNS)**.  
It lets you travel through time — viewing: ownership, configuration, and record changes for an ArNS name.

Built with **Vite + React** and deployed on the **Permaweb**. Each view is static, client-side, and cache-aware so it feels instant the next time you open it.

---

## What It Does

- Browse the **full history** of any ArNS name.  
- See **who owned it, what changed, and when** — all as a timeline of events.  
- Click any event to open an **Event Details panel** with structured info and links on-chain.  
- Filter and highlight categories with the **Legend** (e.g., Ownership Transfer, Record Change).  
- View current name data at a glance in the **Current ANT Bar**.

## How It Works

When you open a name’s history, Rewind:

1. Instantly shows any cached data (so you’re never waiting on the network).  
2. Streams fresh updates from the **ARIO Rewind Service** in batches, buffering for smooth animation.  
3. Lets you scrub the **Holobar** or tap events to explore each moment in time.

The timeline is deterministic — meaning the same data always renders in the same order.

## Why It Exists

ArNS names are permanent, but their stories evolve.  
Rewind makes that evolution **transparent and explorable**, giving builders, auditors, and curious users a complete picture of what’s happened on-chain.

---

### Quick Start

- Visit the main app → **Search for a name** → watch its history unfold.  
- Use the **Legend** to focus on event types you care about.  
- Click a card to see every on-chain detail.
